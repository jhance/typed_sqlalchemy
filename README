This is meant to be a demonstration of how to do some fairly complicated
type semantics using mypy.

Interface is not stable.

Some notes:

- ctx.api.generic_named_type() seemed useless outside of builtins because theres
no way to guarantee that the type you want has been sufficiently processed or
is imported by the module. To get around this, when I want to for example
change a PlaceholderT for T, I inject types I need into the generic values
for PlaceholderT.
